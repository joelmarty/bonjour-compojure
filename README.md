# bonjour_compojure

Just a test app that was created so I can learn about compojure, ring and the
clojure web application ecosystem

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][1] 1.7.0 or above installed.
You will also need a running mongodb server. Use config/app.edn to change the
host/port at your will (no auth at the moment)

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server
